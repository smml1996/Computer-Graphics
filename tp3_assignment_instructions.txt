TP3: More on 3D transformations


Use matrix multiplication instead of rotation+translation to fix the planetâ€™s rotation around the sun.

2. Change glOrtho and use gluPerspective instead. Remember to add a translation in Z axis (-30 units).

3. gluLookAt. Configure the camera and put the earth always at the center of it.

4. Camera trackball.

Render a 3D Gizmo. Complete the 3 defined functions, marked ad (1) (2) (3) on the given source code. 

The first function will capture keyboard events, the second will capture mouse click and the third the mouse movement.

The keyboard must allow to move the camera in ZX plane.

The mouse must allow to rotate the scene.
